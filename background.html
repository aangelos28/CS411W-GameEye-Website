                    Gamers often eagerly wait for new developments on video games that they are looking forward to or
                    games that they own and still have interest in. However, video games often take years to develop. In
                    order to maximize sales, games are marketed years before they are out to the public. By releasing
                    new developments on a game periodically, developers can ensure that a gamer will not lose interest
                    in their game. Due to the periodic release of new developments, gamers will be more likely to
                    purchase a heavily marketed game due not losing interest in the game. Developers often apply the
                    same principle to paid downloadable content (DLC) in order to keep gamers interested in a game that
                    they already purchased.
