                <p>
                    Because of the large number of video games being released annually and their long development timeframes, staying up-to-date about
                    video games of interest and sorting through all the information released by video game developers
                    can be time-consuming and challenging for gamers.

                    There is no&nbsp;<strong>fast</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>easy</strong>&nbsp;way for gamers to
                    "watch" games and stay up to date with&nbsp;information about current and unreleased video games
                    they like. Many gamers often&nbsp;eagerly
                    wait for new video games, waiting for any kind of new developments. Often,
                    it is hard to keep track of all these games and regularly searching&nbsp;online in order to find
                    information gets tiresome after some
                    time, especially over the&nbsp;<strong>long development timeframes&nbsp;</strong>that many games

                        <p>
                            Thousands of new video games come out every year across multiple platforms such as the
                            PC, consoles, and mobile phones [1][2]. Gamers might want to play many of those new
                            games but staying up to date about so many games can
                            be time consuming.

                        <p>
                            Because video games can be in development for several years, staying up to date about
                            them might become tiresome over such long timespans. It is not uncommon for gamers to
                            forget about some games, only to discover them again
                            later while having missed new information about them.

                            Due to the sheer number of new video games that come out every year, it can be hard for
                            gamers to keep track of all the video games they might want to play. Indie games by
                            smaller studios might be affected by this, as they
                            have smaller marketing budgets, and with less exposure gamers thay might have come
                            across them may forget about them as time goes on.

                            Information about video games can be all over the place. Video game studios post
                            information and new developments on their own websites, many post on social media such as Twitter
                            and Reddit, and then there are news on video game
                            news websites and platforms such as Steam. Different information may be posted on each,
                            and gamers might need to look at all these different sources for new information.

                    Gamers often eagerly await for new developments in video games they are looking forward to playing or
                    games that they own and still have interest in. However, video games often take years to develop. In
                    order to maximize sales, games are marketed years before they are out to the public. By releasing
                    information regarding new developments on a game periodically, developers can ensure that
                    gamers will not lose interest in their game. Due to the periodic release of new developments,
                    gamers will be more likely to purchase a heavily marketed game due not losing interest in the game.
                    Developers often apply the same principle to paid downloadable content (DLC) in order to keep gamers
                    interested in a game that they have already purchased.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, the dissemination of new information
                    about video games from developers to gamers is very important, both for the developers because
                    revenues can increase, and for the gamers, who wish to learn more about the video games they want to
                    play or are currently playing.
                    <br><br>
                    Figures <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> below show the correlation between Google Shopping interest and Google News interest
                    for Grand Theft Auto V, the third best-selling video game of all time. Based on the graph, there is a correlation
                    between shopping interest and news interest, as news and shopping interest increase and decrease together.
